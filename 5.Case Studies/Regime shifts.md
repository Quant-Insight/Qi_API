# Regime shifts

The example below details how clients can use Qi data via our API to identify assets undergoing large macro regime shifts. Qi uses a measure called R-squared (RSq) to measure a model's macro explanatory power. Large movements in RSq denote a significant change in the macro regime of an asset. In this instance we look at which global equity indices have had the biggest recent change in RSq, see the article: https://www.quant-insight.com/can-you-afford-not-to-know/ .

The code below shows how Qi manipulated the data to generate these results, and should be of use to any quants who want to repeat this exercise, or incorporate into their own use-case. The bullet point summary shows how a Qi analyst has interpreted the results 

## Case Study: 'Can you afford not to know' - March 2020

* Macro’s ability to explain shifts in European equity indices is increasing dramatically

* The critical drivers of European equities are risk aversion and credit spreads.

* The chart above is the result of looking at all Qi’s Long Term models across global equity indices and identifying the 10 with the biggest R-Squared change over the last month; whether those changes are positive or negative. Equity indices globally all posted strong increases in RSq, i.e. macro’s explanatory power has improved dramatically of late. Seven of the top 10 are European indices.

* The table below lists the top drivers of these new macro regimes. Two factors emerge across all models – the desire for lower risk aversion and tighter credit spreads.
