# Sensitivity Analysis

The example below details how clients can use Qi data via our API to run scenario analysis. In this instance European single stocks sensitive to European inflation expectations, see artlcle: https://www.quant-insight.com/10-eu-stocks-vulnerable-to-deflation/ .


But this kind of search could be replicated across multiple asset classes & for numerous macro factors.


The code below provides an example for quants looking to manipulate the data. The chart / bullet point summary is one suggestion of how to present the results for a portfolio manager looking for optimal trade selection, or a risk manager searching for visibility on their macro exposures.

## Case Study 1: '10 EU Stocks Vulnerable to deflation' - March 2020

* Back in mid February with Western equity markets seemingly immune, the key question facing a European long/short equity fund was which stocks are most vulnerable should Covid-19 spread and unleash a deflationary shock in this time zone? 

* On February 17th , the last week of complacency before the virus reached these shores, we screened the Stoxx 600 universe for those single names most sensitive to European inflation expectations, 

* The 10 stocks Qi identified as most sensitive to inflation fell 43% from February 17th to yesterdayâ€™s close. Over the same period, the Euro Stoxx 600 fell 34%.

* Code:

      ### Variables ###
      universe = [x.name for x in api_instance.get_models(tags='Stoxx Europe 600')][::2]
      date = '2020-02-17'
      term = 'Long Term'
      driver_rank = 7   # The factor has to feature in the top 7 factors for an asset for it to be considered
      no_of_stocks = 10
      factor = 'Euro 5y Infl. Expec.'

      df = pandas.DataFrame()

      for asset in universe:

          try:

              df_temp = get_factor_drivers(asset,date,term).T
              df_temp.index = [asset]        

              if factor in abs(df_temp.loc[asset]).nlargest(driver_rank).index:

                  df = pandas.concat([df, df_temp], axis = 0, join = 'outer')

          except IndexError:

              pass

      df_factor = df[[factor]]
      df_factor['RSq'] = [float(get_model_data(asset,date,date,'Long Term')['Rsq']) for asset in df_factor.index]
      df_top_sensitivite = df_factor[df_factor['RSq']>65].nlargest(no_of_stocks,factor)
      df_top_sensitivite['Name'] = [api_instance.get_model(model).security_name for model in df_top_sensitivite.index]
